%TOC%

The main purpose of this plugin is to allow to set topic variables when saving a topic.
Url parameters posted to =save= will be parsed and stored into the current topic.

Parameters must have the form:
<verbatim class="html">
http://....?[Local|Set|Unset|Default]+<key>=<value>
</verbatim>

Which means:
   * =Local+&lt;key>=&lt;value>= will create a local topic variable called =key= with value =value
   * =Set+&lt;key>=&lt;value>= will create a normal topic variable called =key= with value =value (note if stored in a user topic these take
     effect on all of the site for this user; see the Foswiki documentation for a more in depth explanation)
   * =Unset+&lt;key>=&lt;value>= will remove a topic variable called =key= from the topic
   * =Default+&lt;key>=&lt;value>= defines the default values for a variable =key=; if =key= is set to this value, it will actually be
     remove from the topic as it is being set to a _default_ value

In addition to setting topic variables via url parameters of a =save= action,
this plugin provides means to read and write topic variables in
!WikiApplications. Among other use cases these can be used to create
appropriate html forms for topic variables as far as the function is not
provided by standard TML part of the Foswiki core.

When SETVAR and UNSERVAR are parsed during the discourse of creating the current page they
don't set the topic variable immediately. Instead they create a _definition rule_. All definition rules
are collected and applied to the topic at the end of the parsing process. That way multiple SETVAR
and UNSERVAR - that potentially contradict each other - stack up. The last rule on the stack
wins and decides wether a variable is set or deleted. This allows to create more extensive rule sets.

---++ Syntax Rules
---+++ SETVAR
<verbatim class="tml">%SETVAR{
  "<key>" 
  value="<value>" 
  field="<fieldname>" 
  regex="<pattern>"
}%</verbatim>

This sets topic variable =key= to value =value= if the formfield =fieldname= of the current topic
matches =pattern=.
This allows to set topic variables based on the value of a formfield value. For example, that's useful
to create access control settings automatically.

---+++ UNSETVAR
<verbatim class="tml">%UNSETVAR{
  "<key>" 
  field="<fieldname>" 
  regex="<pattern>"
}%</verbatim>

This unsets topic variable =key= when formfield formfield =fieldname= of the current topic
matches =pattern=

---+++ GETVAR
<verbatim class="tml">%GETVAR{
  "<key|pattern>" 
  web="<web>" 
  topic="<topic>" 
  format="<format>" 
  header="<header>"
  footer="<footer>"
  separator="<separator>"
  type="PREFERENCE|FIELD|TOPICINFO|..."
  sort="on|off"
  default="<default>"
  scope="topic|web|user|session"
}%</verbatim>

This displays a variable =key= as stored in topic =web.topic= and formats it using
the given =format=. It's type can be any of the known Foswiki meta data specifies like
=PREFERENCE=, =FIELD=, =TOPICINFO= etc. When no definition of =key= was found the 
=default= value is returned. Instead of extracting a variable from =web.topic=
it can also be extracted from a specific scope. 

Normally all scopes are layered above each other and only the value defined in
the scope with highest precedence is returned.  So when ever a variable is set
in a topic, it will potentially override its definition on web level or user
level. You may use the =scope= parameter to bypass this logic and extract a
specific value from the given scope specifier.

Multiple variables can be returned by one call if you use a =pattern= instead of 
a =key= holding a regular expression. GETVAR will return all variable values of
the given =type= where the =pattern= matches on the variable name. The list of 
variables will be displayed using =format= preceded by =header= and appended by =footer=.
The =header= and =footer= will be omitted when no matching variable was found.

The =format= string may contain the standard escape parameters 
   * =$percnt=, 
   * =$dollar=, 
   * =$nop= and
   * =$n= as well as
   * =$value= - the value of the current variable
   * =$name= - the name of the current variable
   * =$title= - the title and the
   * =$type= - which is =Set=, =Local=, =Web= or =Session= depending on the type
               and scope of the variable
